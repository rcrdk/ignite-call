## 🎨 About 

<!-- This project was developed based on a Figma design provied by the school. The main practice was the creation of a Design System into a monorepo, a workspace with more than one project inside. It was used TSUP to bundle React and Tokens projects; And Stitches for styling components. All documentation was written using Storybook bases. It was used TurboRepo for running scripts on all packages in parallel and for caching dependencies.

It was used GitHub Actions to publish the [documentation](https://rcrdk.github.io/design-system-ignite/) at GitHub Pages and publish the Tokens and React packages at [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40rcrdk-ignite-ui). Versioning control was made with Changesets. -->
